# rxjs-playground
Reactive extensions playground
==============================



we need a tigth feedback loop, we need a module loader and a package manager. 

Make sure you have node installed with latest, you might need to restart your computer, 
to check your version do as follows.

node --version
npm --version 

Run the npm install to get all the dependencies.

This playground allows us to iterate over the code that executed on the console as well as code that executed in the brwoser.

For the Browser we've got two folders

public = html files
src-client = with JavaScript will be compiled into the public\build folders

for command line we;ve got src-server, runs against node in the command line, and these files will be built in the build folder

We need to tools to be installed globaly, 


WORKFLOW.

We open the command window and we instruct this application to compile our src client and our src server code,

we open another command window, we run either our client code using http server (lite-server) or our server code that will run against node


Tools to install globaly; 

gulp-cli 
live-server or lite-server
